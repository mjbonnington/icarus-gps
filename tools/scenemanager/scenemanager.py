# Scene Manager for DCC apps
# - Automatically handle file save locations, naming conventions and versions.
# - Provide a consistent experience across DCC apps.
# - Make it easier to find latest versions regardless of the last user to work
#   on the file.
#
# Current support is for Maya, Nuke and Houdini.
# In theory, adding support for a new app is as simple as writing a new module
# 'scenemanager_<app>.py' wrapping the basic open/save functionality of the
# app, then add the appropriate entry in the create() function here.
# (Assuming the app supports Python & PySide/PyQt of course).
#
# Initialise at app startup with:
# from tools.scenemanager import scenemanager
# session.scnmgr = scenemanager.create(app='<app>')
